# Vincent's ECE445 Lab Notebook

Week 1 Feb 10 - 14 | General Research and Proposal Writing
=========================================================
We have gotten our project approved and will be working on the “Driver Fatigue System”  
This week I completed the soldering assignment and have gained new skills for this project  
We will also be attending our first TA meeting on Tuesday  
We met up with Maanas and disucessed everything from locker assignments to logistics  
Our proposal for the Driver Fatigue System is written up  
We have talked to Gregg of the Machine Shop for advice on our project  
Given an initial sketch of what we want the device to look like, it was deemed as viable  


Week 2 Feb 17 - 21 |
===================================================================
This week we will be reviewing our project proposal with Instructors and TAs  
Overall, the project proposal review went well  
We did not have to make any changes other than adding a references/citations section for future resources/research that we will be doing  
We will also be starting our pcb design and making a list of all the parts that we need

Week 3 Feb 24 - 28 |
================================================
This week we will be creating our initial PCB design and attending the PCB review session  
This is the initial schematic we created with each part that we intend on using

The PCB review session went great and no changes were made to our inital PCB design  
Some challenges that we had while building the schematic include:  
No native schematic block for most of our parts  
Had to import parts from many different websites  
For the parts with no schematics online, we had to find parts with similar layouts  
same pinholes, same size, etc  



Week 4 Mar 3 - 7 |
========================================================================
This week our Teamwork Evaluation and Design Document are due

Week 5 Mar 10 - 14 |
